- add a configuration file (toml?)
-- keybindings
-- video backend (ncurses, blt, others?)
-- font
-- (and tileset)

-- in-game configuration?



- add tileset support



- proper polymorphism re. user and monsters

-- with pointer type fuckmaging?
--- (void* pointer that points to an instance of struct userstuff* or struct monsterstuff* in the background)
--- this is more complicated, more annoying to think about, and more bug-prone. but it's WAYY more powerful and a bit easier to set up
---- maybe the extra power will become necessary at some point so I should just add it
---- but maybe unnecessary abstraction is like premature optimization
---- only thing I can think of now is that the keybinding map has to be stored somewhere, and struct userstuff is a nice place to put it-- maybe that's reason enough to do it that way

-- or just with straight function pointers?

-- what it comes down to, really, how much of c++ do I want to re-implement



- moar abstraction
